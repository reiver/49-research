§ 49 Research

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**49 Research** was a **software development** company that I **founded** in the year 2008 with a long-time friend, **Radoslav Gazo**.

**49 Research* had a number of customers.
Some of those customers were:

• **British Columbia Lottery Corporation** (**BCLC**),
• **Electronic Arts** (**EA**),
• **Neverblue Media**,
• **Petro-Canada**,
• **Small Business BC** (**SBBC**),
• //and many others//.

§§ 49 Research Logos

**49 Research** had a number of different logos over the years.

I created its first logo:

Later, **Radoslav Gazo** and I decided we wanted a professional logo designer to create us a new logo.
Here are some //concept logos//.

And this ended up being the (final) new logo design:
